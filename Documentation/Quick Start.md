# Quick Start
This guide shows you how write a simple program using the library.

## Steps

1. Installing
2. Hardware Setup
3. Program structure
4. Writing a program


## Installing

Create a new project or use an existing project and install the java-ALUP library using the [Installation guide](/Documentation/Guides/Installing.md "Installation Guide").
Come back here when you're finished.


## Hardware Setup

The ALUP requires 2 devices: 
- a master device which the device using the java-ALUP library will be
- a slave device

You can choose the slave device depending on your needs. If you are unsure, or don't care, an arduino board or an ESP8266
are good choices. Both devices have their pro's and con's.
